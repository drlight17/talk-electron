Sources are mess but it works =)

Check my app if you are unsatisfied by [official Nextcloud Talk Desktop app](https://github.com/nextcloud/talk-desktop).

# Minimum OS requirements
MacOS 10.15 Catalina, Windows 7/2008, Linux with modern kernel version (5.x) - all x64 compatible only, no more 32-bit support (since 0.5.1-alpha)

## Works correctly with Nextcloud since v.28.x.x till v.31.x.x and since Talk v.18.x till v.21.x.x

# ‚öôÔ∏è Supported settings
All app settings are saved in the local user folder in file config.json:
- MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/NC Talk Electron`

- Linux `~/.config/NC Talk Electron`

Supported setting arguments (see example.config.json):

# üî® For developers
Build depends on the platform since 0.2.9-alpha version as it brings support of the system idle detect function.

For Windows:
```
choco install python312 visualstudio2019community visualstudio2019-workload-nativedesktop visualstudio2019buildtools windows-sdk-10.0
pip install setuptools
git clone https://github.com/drlight17/talk-electron
cd ./talk-electron
cp ./package.json.windows ./package.json
```
For Linux:
```
apt install libxss-dev pkg-config
git clone https://github.com/drlight17/talk-electron
cd ./talk-electron
cp ./package.json.linux ./package.json
```
For Macos:
```
git clone https://github.com/drlight17/talk-electron
cd ./talk-electron
cp ./package.json.windows ./package.json
```
Platform independent steps:
```
npm install -g node-gyp
npm install --save-dev electron-rebuild
npx electron-rebuild
```
OR run `prepare.sh`

To build win32 x86 (32bit) app remove **node_modules\sharp\\** after previous common commands, use **package.json.win32-ia32** as package.json and run: 
```
npm install --force --platform=win32 --arch=ia32 sharp
```
To run dev app use:
```
npm start 
```

In dev mode config path includes '-dev'

To build distributive use:
```
npm run dist
```
If there are any module errors try to `npx electron-rebuild` before every `npm start` or `npm run dist`.

Also check [package.json.linux](package.json.linux) and [package.json.windows](package.json.windows). Pay attention: [package.json.windows](package.json.windows) should be used for macos development and build.

# üí∞ Support
This application is absolutely free. But any attention motivates me to support the application. You can send a donation of $1 or more to a TON wallet:
```

```
and/or [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/drlight17/talk-electron.svg?style=social&label=Star&logo=github)](https://github.com/drlight17/talk-electron) this repository. 

As a reward for this, you can request a license using [current version](https://github.com/drlight17/talk-electron/releases/latest) of the app by providing your email, from which you will send confirmation of your attention (screenshot or something you consider important).

In any case, the application's functionality is not limited in any way. Having a license will simply remove the periodic reminder (1 per week) and the button with this form from the main menu.
