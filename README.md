# talk-electron
Simple electron wrapper app for Nextcloud Talk. Learning some nodejs and electron basics while building simple Nextcloud Talk Desktop app for easy enterprise deployment.

Sources are mess but it works =)

Planning to use some things from this project as PRs to the [official Nextcloud Talk Desktop app](https://github.com/nextcloud/talk-desktop).
